# IW4x Discord bot

This is the bot for the [IW4x](https://iw4x.io/) Discord server, and at the moment primarily provides functionality to users seeking basic help / information.

# Building

System dependencies: `go`, (see go.mod for versioning info), though this should build fine on older versions (within reason) assuming the minimum requirement for the discordgo version defined in go.mod is met. 

1. Clone the source, move to its directory.
2. `go get github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo` to pull the discordgo library
3. `go build -ldflags="-s -w"` in the source directory, the `ldflags` here strips the binary to reduce resource usage
4. After building, you should have a resulting `iw4x-discord-bot` binary, done!

# Running

As this produces a single binary, it can simply be run as (preferably) part of a system service (it is service manager agnostic), or with a script, or in a tmux/screen session, or however else desired.

The environment variable `IW4X_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` must be set- and should of course contain the token for the bot.
